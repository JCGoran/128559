<html><pre>This is the readme for the model associated with

Aguiar P, Sousa M, Lima D (2010) NMDA channels together with L-type
calcium currents and calcium-activated nonspecific cationic currents
are sufficient to generate windup in WDR neurons. J Neurophysiol
104:1155-66

This model is also available as a web link through the paper:

You can either auto-launch the model or download the zip file, expand
compile the mod files, and run mosinit.hoc to regenerate figure 2C:
